The theme of the hackathon was to empower linguistic diversity in newsrooms. The hackathon was held during the International Mother Language Day (Feb. 21-22, 2020).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nOften media sites translate quotes and names using automated tools, and mistakes creep in. Sometimes its humans who inadvertedly make translation mistakes. This project aims to find ways to highlight such errors and offer alternative suggestions on media sites.\r\n\r\nKey question: How to highlight translation mistakes and offer suggestions for improvement?\r\n\r\n#### Translation mistakes that occure frequently\r\n\r\n- Idioms - Idiom is a phrase or an expression that has a figurative, or sometimes literal, meaning.\r\n- Quotes\r\n- Negations\r\n- Translations of tense\r\n- Change of meaning and style\r\n- \"Translationese\" - Awkwardness or ungrammaticality of translation, such as due to overly literal translation of idioms or syntax.\r\n- \"False Friends\" - False friends are words in different languages that look or sound similar, but differ significantly in meaning (English: embarrassed -> Spanish: embarazada (which means pregnant))\r\n\r\n### Approach\r\n\r\nA list of sentences with a \"good\" and a \"bad\" translations was collected. Based on that dataset multiple checks where implemented. The result of these checks is visualized in an interface. The interface allows the autors to quickly identify potentially flawed translations and fix them.\r\n\r\n#### Potential checks\r\n\r\n- Wordcount per sentence (implemented)\r\n- Wordcount per document\r\n- False friend detection (implemented)\r\n- Sentiment analysis\r\n- Negation detection\r\n- Idiom detection\r\n- Readability - [FLESCH-Index](https://fleschindex.de/berechnen)\r\n\r\n### Potential improvements\r\n\r\n- Currently there are only a few checks implemented. The project could be extended with more checks in the future. See the list above to see what could be implemented next.\r\n- The source dataset is very small. It should be extended with more data, which would allow to further improve the checks.\r\n- The current solution doesn't allow to detect bad translations dynamically. It's not possible to edit the tranlations in the interface directly and see if the translation is improved.\r\n\r\n### Develop\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngit clone git@github.com:manuelroth/lost-in-translation.git\r\ncd lost-in-translation/client/\r\nnpm run dev\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Deploy\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnpm install --global surge\r\ncd lost-in-translation/client/\r\nnpm run build\r\nsurge public\r\n```\r\n","autotext_url":"https://github.com/manuelroth/lost-in-translation","contact_url":"https://github.com/manuelroth/lost-in-translation/issues","created_at":"2019-11-13T12:10","event_name":"Multilingual Media","event_url":"https://db.schoolofdata.ch/event/4","excerpt":"### Challenge\r\n\r\nOften media sites translate quotes and names using automated tools, and mistakes creep in.

We could not find materials that are suitable for beginners and small children. So we came up with the idea of creating a game Ha Hu (a term equivalent to ABC) that is based on the demands and experiences of our children. The game simplifies Amharic/Ge'ez alphabets into basic geometrical  forms (lines and circles) and teaches step by step how to read and write, teaching children and beginners the Amharic Alphabet in a simple and engaging way. \r\n\r\nThe **Amharic/Ge\u2019ez alphabet** is also used by many other  semetic languages including Tigrigna, a language spoken by a significant Eritrean community residing in [Switzerland](https://www.swissinfo.ch/action/eng/40468904/search?query=eritrea&submit=Search). Hence we believe this product will be very useful for Ethiopian and Eritrean diaspora communities that are not able to  provide formal language education to their children in their mother tongue languages.\r\n\r\n#### Hackathon goals\r\n\r\n1. Familiarize with the concept of Gamifying Language Learning.\r\n2. Create a game prototype for teaching Amharic/ Ge\u2019ez alphabets.\r\n\r\n#### Further ideas\r\n\r\n- Develop the concept further, i.e. to reach a wider audience for language learning through journalism.\r\n- Adapt the game for languages that use the same alphabet (Eg, Tigrigna, Guragigna, Agew\u2026) and beyond.\r\n- Produce children\u2019s educational content in other formats (Books, E-books, videos, augmented and VR products, ...)\r\n\r\n#### Why #swihack?\r\n\r\nGoing beyond the humble Crossword and Sudoku, **game design** is increasingly a part of journalism. Digitally published stories can include multimedia content which engages and teaches the visitor. For example, see [Heaven's Vault](https://www.republik.ch/2019/07/01/tote-sprachen-leben-laenger), [Spiel des Lebens](https://www.republik.ch/2019/05/01/spiel-des-lebens) (both via Republik) and [Designing Games for Stories](https://www.propublica.org/nerds/creating-games-for-journalism) (ProPublica).

Notes\r\n\r\n- Is there a way to make translating text overlay as simple and time efficient as translating subtitles?\r\n- Having different language versions linked to the same master project works in Adobe After Effects but not in Premiere Pro.\r\n- Can we export the text layer from Premiere, translate it, and reimporte it?\r\n- Do we need to move to an online tool or can we ask Software developers to improve Premiere Pro?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/nimbling/aetextio\r\n\r\nWhat would we want from Adobe Premiere Pro?\r\n\r\n- Write our text directly in Premiere, then export it\r\n- Reimport it in another language\r\n- Be able to work with a different alphabet from one same file, without the entire project having to be in a given language from the beginning to the end (ie, enable translation from and into Arabic)\r\n\r\nRight now, the closest we can get to a subtitle-type workflow is burning subtitles into a video, but without any animation (simple subtitle).\r\n\r\nCheck this out: https://codepen.io/guttentag/post/animated-svg-text-message-video-overlay\r\n\r\nSolution suggested by Beno\u00eet (SwissTXT):\r\n\r\n- the video is edited in Premiere, a cleanfeed is exported as well as an .srt file \r\n- cleanfeed and .srt are imported into Subtitle Editor, which allows editors to adjust text position etc\r\n- a .ttml file is exported, which includes position information\r\n- the journalists translate this .ttml file, which can be reimported into Subtitle Editor and adjusted if needed, then a final .ttml file is exported\r\n- this file is converted into SSA, which can apply different profiles to the text (color, font, animation)\r\n- the .ssa file and the cleanfeed are imported into Hand Brake for transcoding (the text is burnt in)\r\n\r\n![](https://us-east-1.linodeobjects.com/dribdat/uploads/upload_853e043c6c2d5dc561495a338b2969be.png)\r\n\r\n![](https://us-east-1.linodeobjects.com/dribdat/uploads/upload_fa6da6eb571a2ae87ae69e15e739d815.png)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RoxaneBrcly/subtitles","maintainer":"autoidlabs.ch","name":"Multilingual

The technical community makes an effort to support languages on the \"front end\", i.e. web site content, but translation support is often missing in data sources and APIs. For example, it is often not possible to make a multilingual tweet or forum post. There is a multitude of ways data sources get translated. Can we benefit from the skill and experience of our communities more, especially in a country like .ch to tackle this question in the service of journalism? Do you have ideas about designing / installing / funding / automating / humanizing solutions to overcome this?\r\n\r\n## Suggested hackathon goals\r\n\r\n1. What do you see as the main barriers in overcoming linguistic adversity when it comes to *data* publication?\r\n2. Put the problem into human context: after all, people are authors of most datasets. How could we stimulate multilingual data collection?\r\n3. Are there any particular ways that multilingual open data initiatives could assist certain kinds of journalistic efforts?\r\n\r\n### Inspiration\r\n\r\n- Take a look at the pattern for [language support in Frictionless Data](https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/patterns/#language-support), which provides a couple of ways to use multiple languages both in data and data descriptors (metadata). You can participate in the open discussion and help make the proposal part of the specs (via [Augusto Herrmann](https://discuss.okfn.org/t/february-2020-hackathon-on-multilingual-media/9036/2))\r\n- Drawing on examples from our community, such as the [Wikidata multilingual support](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Multilingual_Wikidata), share some good *use cases* in particular which we could address in this hackathon project (via [Lionel Walter](https://hack.opendata.ch/project/263))\r\n- [Discourse](https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-translator/32630) plugins, [language support](https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/patterns/#language-support) patterns, [leaderboards](https://microsoftl10n.github.io/index.html), tools like [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/) come to mind - any other suggestions when it comes to technology? \r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\nThe open data community both [in Switzerland](https://forum.opendata.ch) and [internationally](https://discuss.okfn.org) tries to overcome cultural and language barriers and support the needs of a diverse membership. The association [Opendata.ch](https://opendata.ch) pioneered multilingual, simultaneous hackathons, while [Opendata.swiss](https://opendata.swiss) is one of the world's few quadrilingual open data portals. This challenge is proposed by open data activist Oleg Lavrovsky, who gets by in a handful of languages but often regrets not speaking Italian, Romansch, or any of the many other tongues heard on our globalized streets.","maintainer":"loleg","name":"Translating Access to Data","phase":"Challenge","progress":-1,"score":0,"source_url":"","summary":"Make a statement about the value of multilingual data!","team":"loleg, patrickboehler, VVBaldassarre","updated_at":"2020-02-21T09:54","url":"https://db.schoolofdata.ch/project/37","webpage_url":"https://md.schoolofdata.ch/-N8IHgEvTXKlJmbklGylgA#"},{"autotext":"","autotext_url":"","contact_url":"","created_at":"2020-02-12T20:33","event_name":"Multilingual Media","event_url":"https://db.schoolofdata.ch/event/4","excerpt":"Although Swiss citizens vote four times a year on the same topic, the way the issues are framed varies from a language region to the other.
