It is important for us that the analogue hands-on installation on slavery has a digital pendant. That would enable us to collect data on how the audiences relate to and position themselves regarding this history. It will also enable those who don\u2019t have access to the physical exhibition to participate.\r\n\r\nEXPLAINATIONS\r\n\r\nThe physical version of the installation will work as follow:\r\n\r\n![dispositif mediation.png](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/11558/P1XJR44MU4LEV7X18VG4UX74/dispositif_mediation.png)\r\n\r\nVisitors will have to pick a pre-cut thread from five boxes. Each box contains threads of a specific colour and corresponds to one of the following affirmations:\r\nMy ancestors were enslaved\r\nMy ancestors participated or benefited directly or indirectly from slavery\r\nI am not directly concerned by slavery\r\nMy country benefited directly or indirectly from slavery\r\nI don't know what my links to slavery are\r\n\r\nThen, the visitor faces an oval mural on which 15 words are written. In very close proximity (immediately above or under or next to) each word there\u2019s a nail.\r\nThe visitor is invited to tie their thread around the different nails that correspond to the words or word they most identify with.\r\nThe words are as follow:\r\n\r\n1. Ignorance\r\n2. Anger\r\n3. Hatred / Rage\r\n4. Impotence\r\n5. Disgust\r\n6. Humiliation\r\n7. Shame\r\n8. Suffering\r\n9. Courage\r\n10. Empathy\r\n11. Indifference\r\n12. Discomfort\r\n13.

The collection is known worldwide and has a great reputation in art history. Thanks to a grant from the Federal Office of Culture, the museum has undertaken a project that takes an in-depth look at the collector Charles A. Drenowatz (1908-1979), who acquired his paintings in the 1950s-1960s, as well as the history of the works' transmission and the networks through which Drenowatz was able to assemble the collection.\r\n\r\nPainting occupies a very special place in the Chinese art canon. Works by famous artists found their way into the palace collections of the imperial family as well as into the important private collections of members of the upper class. What is unique about Chinese painting is that often not only the artist put an inscription and his seal on the painting, but also the recipient of the painting, friends and acquaintances of the artist, but also later owners, famous art critics and other expert viewers. In the course of time, these additions became a fixed but continuously expanding component of the work of art. At the same time, they are extremely important documentary sources, which makes Chinese painting an ideal subject for provenance research.\r\n\r\nOver the course of this project the information was gathered in the museums database. For each painting the seals, stamps (in this project referred as \"Provenienzmerkmal\" or \"PM\") and inscriptions were analysed, transcribed where possible and connected to the people who were the owner of those seals. This created a dense network of people, artworks and provenances that are documented in the database. Be aware, that these provenances are not by any means complete, or are following the traditional western idea of provenance as ownership. As written above, seal might have been added by connaisseurs who didn't own the painting. Nevertheless these clues give us an idea on the biography of the painting.\r\n\r\n![ Title ](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/11544/35AH16ISK267B41Z8DZC6XY7/Schema_Database.png)\r\n![ Title ](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/11544/1SSP4J8VHRZ1JX3UUHHFTGTP/Beispiel_Challenge.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe data will be delivered in four different .json files and a .zip archive with the fotos.

Decolonising the MEG's inventories through research and analysis of semantic violence : create a programme to tag MEG inventories and identify racist and discriminative terms or problematic provenance indications.\r\n\r\nDATASETS: https://opendata.swiss/dataset/metadata-meg-collections\r\n\r\nCONTEXT: MEG offers online consultation of the 70,000 objects in its collections, using inventory sheets supplemented by one or more photographs of each item, a \"cartel\" or \"list\" description and links to the various digitised old inventory registers.\r\n\r\nFar from being neutral and objective, metadata has inherited the information contained in the inventories that preceded it, and is always historically situated.\r\n\r\nAn OCR scan of the MEG inventory registers, which were drawn up between 1901 and 1993, can be used to search by keyword for colonial, racist or disrespectful terms, or indications of an acquisition context that is ethically reprehensible today.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this challenge is to create a programme to search and tag the MEG's metadata for discriminatory, racist and violent semantic traces in the description of its collections:\r\n\r\n* relating to the denomination or invisibilisation of the identity of their creators, the people depicted on the artworks and the cultural owners\r\n* relating to the description and supposed use of the object\r\n* relating to provenance, i.e. more precisely to the acquisition process (theft, looting, confiscation, unfair trade during colonial era).\r\n\r\nAs part of its commitment to transparency, the museum also has a duty to warn and guide users of its historical data so that they are not confronted with violent and racist terms without contextual warning.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that the disclaimers/tags appear on the online database of the MEG: https://www.ville-ge.ch/meg/sql/musinfo00.php\r\n\r\nMETHOD:\r\n-Create a thesorus of colonial, racist, problematic terms to be search in the database and OCR scan\r\n-Build a disclaimer system which could respond to different cases of semantic violences\r\n-Create a programm capable of producing a \"decolonial\" analysis of the ethically reprehensible information contained in the MEG database\r\n\r\nCONTACT: Floriane

They also provide sometimes some very useful contextualizing information about the biography of the object. Plus, they show how the objects were used by European institutions to produce colonial knowledge on colonized people and their material heritage.\r\n\r\nThe information provided by these documents hasn\u2019t always been transferred to the digital database. Thus, curators and researchers spend a lot of time searching the old inventories to potentially find some more information on the objects they\u2019re working on. Such a program would be really helpful for all (provenance) research to be done in the future on the MEG objects.\r\n\r\n##  Traces of colonial knowledge production\r\n\r\nThe City of Geneva's ethnography collection was brought together in 1901 in a single exhibition site, which became the Mus\u00e9e d'ethnographie. The collection is made up of several collections from different public and private museums, including the Mus\u00e9e des missions and the Mus\u00e9e arch\u00e9ologique. These collections are described in original handwritten inventories, with specific numbering. When the Mus\u00e9e d'ethnographie was created, a new inventory grouping together the various collections was handwritten until 1973. Between 1973 and 1993, the continuation of this register was typed. At the same time, to facilitate consultation and protect the handwritten registers, the entire MEG inventory register (1901-1971) was also typed. The paper registers were subsequently replaced by computerised systems.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nThe inventory entry of the object [ETHAF 034815, Victory at the Battle of Adwa (1896)](http://www.ville-ge.ch/meg/sql/musinfo_public.php?id=034815) is linked with two inventory book (see bottom of the inventory page).\r\n\r\n![ Title ](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/11532/WMM0WTQKRX7ZIG0334FFG2RT/Adwa_1.PNG)\r\n\r\nThe first inventory [Copie dactylographi\u00e9e en 13 volumes de l'Inventaire original MEG manuscrit](http://www.ville-ge.ch/meg/musimages/registres/Registres_inventaire_dactylographie/3399.pdf) (which is a typed copy of the other one) was digitized with an OCR system. So, in this case, it was possible to link the exact page of the inventory related to this object.\r\n\r\nWhen you click on the link, you access the corresponding inventory entry:\r\n\r\n![ Title ](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/11532/AT8A0RZQ6T810W4SOQ1WBQ8T/Adwa2.PNG)\r\n\r\nThe handwritten inventories however wasn't yet digitized with an OCR system. Thus, the link leads [to the whole handwritten inventory book](http://www.ville-ge.ch/meg/sql/doc/Registre_17_034278_035177.pdf).\r\n\r\n![ Title ](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/11532/3HE2V9KFDCS538TXUJMDI9OJ/Adwa_3.PNG)\r\n\r\nInstead of leading to the whole inventory book, we'd like the link to lead to the corresponding page of the inventory:\r\n\r\n![ Title ](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/11532/TFFY7NT4JJF1SPFHJ3Y0B0FW/Adwa_4.PNG)\r\n\r\nThe idea of this challenge would thus be\r\n\r\n* to create a program to read and transcribe the handwritten MEG inventories\r\n* to link the page containing an inventory entry with the corresponding object page in the museum database.\r\n\r\nOne problem case to be faced during the challenge: The inventory sheet of the number 025988 extends overs five pages of the register.

The aim of this project is to enable the residents of Geneva to re-consider the city's urban space from the perspective of its colonial and racist heritage. This application is an essential tool for making the data in the report accessible to people who are unfamiliar with this theme in urban space.\r\n\r\nThe challenge is to make the data attractive and arouse the public's curiosity and desire to consult it. Visuals, illustrations and user-friendliness are central to the success of this application.\r\n\r\nEach monument or street mentioned in the report would be represented by a dot on the map of Geneva. It would then be possible to zoom in on the map to discover a particular area. When you click on a monument or street name, a historical note opens with the text of the report and historical information.\r\n\r\nIn the report, the monuments are classified according to different keywords. It would be possible to reflect these categories using a colour code on the map, or to allow monuments to be 'sorted' by keyword.\r\n\r\nWe'd like to add images of the different locations to the historical notices. We could perhaps use Wikipedia/Wikimedia images for that.\r\n\r\nThis map will be shown on a touch station in the central area of the next temporary exhibition at MEG \"Remembering. Geneva in the colonial world\" (03.05.2024-01.05.2025). The map would also be accessible online on the colonialgeneva.ch digital platform (the digital version of the physical exhibition) and on the City of Geneva project website \"Monuments and racist heritage in public areas\" (www.geneve.ch/heritage-raciste)\r\n\r\nINSPIRATION:\r\nThe website \u201cbern-kolonial\u201d: https://bern-kolonial.ch/wilkommen\r\n\r\nSOURCES:\r\nMohamed Mahmoud Mohamedou et Davide Rodogno\r\nTemps, espaces et histoires\r\nMonuments et h\u00e9ritage raciste et colonial dans l\u2019espace public genevois :\r\n\u00e9tat des lieux historique\r\n\r\nCONTACT:\r\nMarina Berazategui (MEG)\r\n\r\n[Click here to access the report in pdf format](https://www.geneve.ch/sites/default/files/2022-03/monuments-heritage-raciste-colonial-espace-public-etude-2022-ville-geneve.pdf)\r\n\r\n[Click here to access the report in word format](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eAqngqAvWnVprocT6269sq79AbbBuhXf/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113831577923411545324&rtpof=true&sd=true)\r\n\r\n[Click here to access the excel database extracted from the report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DVC6uX653xEKe2wX5WBo5dA6BJLNQ2HWlaSAGkNCSso/edit#gid=0)\r\n\r\nMonuments et h\u00e9ritage raciste dans l\u2019espace public : [www.geneve.ch/heritage-raciste](www.geneve.ch/heritage-raciste)\r\n\r\nSlack: https://glamhackchworkspace.slack.com/archives/C05UQRXD5FT","maintainer":"marina_berazategui","name":"Tracking down colonial and racist traces in Geneva","phase":"Project","progress":5,"score":30,"source_url":"","stats":{"commits":0,"during":5,"people":7,"sizepitch":3009,"sizetotal":3111,"total":27,"updates":19},"summary":"create an interactive map of Geneva to track down the racist and colonial traces in the city of Geneva","team":"marina_berazategui, liowalter, floriane_morin, Gregoire_de_Ceuninck, Bertrand_Cassegrain, Can, FlorMchainWMCH","team_count":7,"updated_at":"2024-05-02T23:00","url":"https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/project/180","webpage_url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mhfl22MhAQ6f1WnMPMIvSRMsgojYmyf3/preview"},{"autotext":"","autotext_url":"","category_id":"","category_name":"","contact_url":"","created_at":"2023-09-28T20:33","download_url":"","event_name":"GLAMhack 2023","event_url":"https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/event/10","excerpt":"**[Traditional Knowledge labels](https://localcontexts.org/labels/traditional-knowledge-labels/) (TK Labels)** are an initiative for Indigenous communities and local organizations that allows them to express conditions for sharing their materials and engage in research in ways that respect community rules, governance and protocols for using, sharing and circulating knowledge and data.\r\n\r\nThe set of tools for communities includes additionally **[Biocultural (BC) Labels](https://localcontexts.org/...","hashtag":"18","id":202,"ident":null,"image_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/WikimediaMosaicCapture.png/600px-WikimediaMosaicCapture.jpg","is_challenge":false,"is_webembed":true,"logo_color":"","logo_icon":"","longtext":"**[Traditional Knowledge labels](https://localcontexts.org/labels/traditional-knowledge-labels/) (TK Labels)** are an initiative for Indigenous communities and local organizations that allows them to express conditions for sharing their materials and engage in research in ways that respect community rules, governance and protocols for using, sharing and circulating knowledge and data.\r\n\r\nThe set of tools for communities includes additionally **[Biocultural (BC) Labels](https://localcontexts.org/labels/biocultural-labels/)** that are used to define expectations about appropriate use of biocultural collections and data.\r\n\r\nThe **[Notices](https://localcontexts.org/notices/aboutnotices/)** are tools for institutions and researchers to identify Indigenous collections and data and recognize Indigenous rights and interests.\r\n\r\nHow can these labels be used on Wikimedia Commons?

After returning to Basel, he spent years to manage this data and allocate it to museum categories. His huge collection of objects and photographs is well known as well as his publications. Browsing his notebooks, however, one can find a wild assemblage of different genres, from names of people and places, to anthropometric calculations, from cartoons to true to detail drawings, from detailed observations to strands of thoughts. As this material is so extensive and on top, his handwriting is very hard to read, this data seems to refuse access and analyzation.\r\n\r\nHaving the colonial burden of museum categories in mind, our project seeks not to use those categories again, but to find alternative ways to make the Felix Speiser archive accessible. Although the archive should be open to the public, we want to reach out to communities from Vanuatu and other stakeholders to work with the Felix Speiser archive and the Museum der Kulturen Basel as an institution. How can this extensive material be tamed, and its mostly unknown content be made accessible so that not only the museum can work with it but people around the world?\r\n\r\nTo achieve more accessibility, we would be very interested in being able to search Speiser notebooks for certain key terms. Toponyms, people names or travel routes, that are dispersed in different formats of notebooks, could be particularly valuable. Or data on objects, certain cluster of words, colonial content or architectural features to name a few examples. In shifting the focus, we hope to reconsider and finally decolonize Felix Speiser\u2019s legacy.\r\n\r\nImage source: [abebooks](https://www.abebooks.com/first-edition/Two-Years-Natives-Western-Pacific-Felix/31378328223/bd)","maintainer":"MauriceBonvin","name":"Telling a different story: a new reading of subalternity in notebooks","phase":"Challenge","progress":0,"score":3,"source_url":"","stats":{"commits":0,"during":0,"people":3,"sizepitch":1860,"sizetotal":1860,"total":7,"updates":3},"summary":"","team":"MauriceBonvin, piloublan, Basil","team_count":3,"updated_at":"2023-09-29T07:54","url":"https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/project/193","webpage_url":"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRVgeCO_IOAjKUPfUPvSLTzfKppKuvH_h40KDLUwtySPgdPHo7XzNWrZ7FAnhfN8A/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.g285a610f7bf_1_11"},{"autotext":"<p>Challenge: Accessibility of Cultural Events</p><p></p><p>The Opendata.ch association, in cooperation with several event data platform providers, is in the process of setting up a new working group on Open Event Data.

It relies on current infrastructures and technologies, in a way that is scalable and can be used by institutions and research communities around the world starting today, independently of their resource situation, making use of infrastructures and tools that are accessible to all and are in line with the Digital Public Goods Standard<sup><a href=\"#ftnt1\">[1]</a></sup>. Furthermore, the approach allows for a pluralist take on the description of heritage holdings, based on an open collaborative approach, independently from the processes in place at individual institutions. \u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><h1 id=\"h.hqjixqjsircg\">State-of-the-Art regarding the Description of Collections </h1><p>As regards references to, and the description of heritage collections, based on Wikidata, the approach has been concretized and documented for the field of the performing arts<sup><a href=\"#ftnt2\">[2]</a></sup>, but is extensible to any field and all types of heritage collections. So far, most of the data entered on Wikidata concern archival holdings about persons. Further entities to be linked to may include organizations, places/venues, creative works, (cultural) events, etc. Research has been carried out to study data modeling practices, resulting in recommendations for best practices<sup><a href=\"#ftnt3\">[3]</a></sup>. Approaches to add statements based on existing collection metadata have successfully been tested<sup><a href=\"#ftnt4\">[4]</a></sup>.</p><p></p><p>The flexibility of Wikidata allows almost everything (or even \u201ethe sum of the human knowledge\u201c) to be described in its knowlegde graph. The area of event data\u00a0is has so far only sparsely been covered in authority files. Only about 9 % \u00a0of the data stored in the \u201eGemeinsame Normdatei\u201d (GND) is about events<sup><a href=\"#ftnt5\">[5]</a></sup>. At the same time, the materials stored and catalogued in heritage institutions are full of (hidden) relations to events, mentioned either in the finding aids/catalogues or in the content itself. Thus, by providing more precise event (authority) data, the retrieval of those materials would be made much more effective. Such events may occur in any domain, such as political events (elections, polls), artistic events, sport events, or any other occurrence where something could be linked to a date or time period, linked with place(s), and possibly persons related to those events<sup><a href=\"#ftnt6\">[6]</a></sup>.</p><p></p><h1 id=\"h.g7suuvm2s6c4\">State-of-the-Art Regarding Applications</h1><p>In addition to ingesting the data into Wikidata, it is important to develop applications making use of the data thus made available. First applications exist for the referencing of archival holdings about persons (e.g. infoboxes on French Wikipedia). Furthermore, a pilot application has been developed in the course of a Hackathon Series among Swiss Research Libraries that integrates the approach in a Library Discovery System<sup><a href=\"#ftnt7\">[7]</a></sup>.</p><p></p><p>A\u00a0dialogue with the ETH Library, SWITCH, and SLSP, in view of the integration of such data in the online discovery service of the Swiss libraries, Swisscovery, as well as into the SWITCH Research Data Connectome<sup><a href=\"#ftnt8\">[8]</a></sup>, is currently taking place. </p><p></p><p>A general search application exploiting both the \u201carchives at\u201d, \u201cdocumentation files at\u201d, etc. statements on Wikidata in all their combinations with different types of entities as well as \u201cdepicts\u201d statements on Wikimedia Commons, is currently missing.\u00a0</p><p></p><p></p><h1 id=\"h.lxub7hmscfo9\">Some initial ideas what could be worked on:</h1><p></p><ul><li>Carry out prototypical ingests\u00a0of less common combinations of the \u201carchives at\u201d, \u201cdocumentation files at\u201d, etc. properties and different types of entities.

This could be done with the support of already available machine learning algorithms, to be trained with provenance data from various sources.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nLevel 1: Parse\r\nThe provenance texts should be split into the separate transaction events. Each entry related to a transaction should contain metadata such as the time range and location, transaction type, as well as the involved actors (previous owner, new owner, as well as transaction facilitators like auction houses). This step will need comparison with dictionaries and other authority files to correctly parse the provenance information. And can it handle texts in different languages (English, German, French, \u2026)?\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nLevel 2: Link\r\nGet additional information from Wikidata to fill in gaps. This comes in handy when e.g. only the name of an art trader or institution is available, but related geodata is missing. This could save quite some future research time if scaled up properly!
