On each page we have linked to optional tools, such as [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw), which are recommended for digital ideation sprints. Once you join a challenge, you can work as a team using any tool. Make progress through a series of [workshop stages](/event/2/resources) by regularly **Posting updates** with sketches, screenshots or comments.\r\n\r\n#### If you have any questions, please reach out the event organizers: [\u2709\ufe0f Sandro](mailto:sandro.suter@hslu.ch) or [\u2709\ufe0f Anna](mailto:anna.para@hslu.ch)\r\n\r\n<br clear=\"all\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pre-event\r\n\r\nAfter the Challenge Pitch on February 4, the list of preferred challenges will be published. You can choose which challenge(s) you are interested in. Taking your priorities into consideration, the organizers will build a diverse **4-6 people team** for each challenge that you see above. Until the main event on March 14, you are invited to already think what ideas you already have as well as what skills you can contribute. You can already reflect on potential solutions to the presented challenges and what resources would be needed to solve the problem. The more you have already thought about the challenges the faster you and your team can get your hands at work.\r\n\r\n## Digital ideation\r\n\r\nTo facilitate the event and the challenges, we are using several web applications - the one you are looking at now is [Dribdat](https://dribdat.cc): a playful ideation and open source challenge board to help organize co-creative sessions. This platform helps teams to sustain and to document their efforts, streamlining things for the organising team. We have pre-configured each challenge with an [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw) canvas and a [Systemic Design Framework](https://festival.tourismdata.ch/project/21) template. You can find this and further materials in the **[Resource area](https://festival.tourismdata.ch/event/2/resources)**.\r\n\r\n## If you're stuck\r\n\r\nCheck out the [Help area & Handbook](/about) to get an understanding of the platform and how it is used for hackathons all around [Switzerland](https://dribdat.cc/tour). You can also take part in our Q&A Calls, that are organized on **17th February** and on **10th March** at 15.00. During the calls we will show you how to work with our platforms and try to answer all your questions. Participation is not compulsory. We will of course, also have staff and helpers on location during the event to help you out!\r\n\r\n## What to bring\r\n\r\nTo attend the Festival in Zurich on March 14, we mostly need you to show up with plenty of motivation and in a good mood to hack tourism challenges! You will be successful if you are open-minded and are ready to tackle the tasks within a team. To actively work on the challenges, you should bring a laptop - please don't forget your charging cable `;)`\r\n\r\n## At the event\r\n\r\nThe event in Zurich starts with a welcoming Coffee and Get together. After that the teams for the challenges will start working together. The goal of the Innovation and Mapping Festival is to create a first prototype for the challenge. Depending on the challenge you will solve it by preparing a conceptual solution, but you can also program an algorithm - the most important thing is to solve your challenge in a creative and multidisciplinary way.\r\n","location":"Switzerland Tourism","location_lat":47.37087,"location_lon":8.52935,"logo_url":"https://www.tourismdata.ch/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/logo_beta.svg","name":"Innovation and Mapping Festival","starts_at":"2025-02-04T09:15","summary":"Welcome, Bienvenue, Gr\u00fcezi, Benvenuti, \u0623\u0647\u0644\u0627 \u0628\u0643, \u0ba8\u0bb2\u0bcd\u0bb2 \u0ba8\u0bbe\u0bb3\u0bcd ...","webpage_url":""}],"name":"events"},{"data":[{"autotext":"","autotext_url":"","category_id":1,"category_name":"Destination Lab","contact_url":"","created_at":"2025-02-04T16:09","download_url":"https://www.tourismdata.ch/events/innovation-and-mapping-festival/challenges/climate-resilience-in-tourism/","event_name":"Innovation and Mapping Festival","event_url":"https://festival.tourismdata.ch/event/1","excerpt":"Climate change poses significant challenges for tourist destinations.

Context and Challenge**\r\n\r\n### **The Problem:**\r\n\r\nAutumn in the Alps, particularly in **Crans-Montana and Anniviers**, is an **untapped tourism season**. While winter and summer attract high visitor numbers, late autumn sees **low tourism activity**, with many businesses closing and limited structured offers for visitors.\r\n\r\n### **Why It Matters:**\r\n\r\n* **Economic Potential**: Businesses struggle to remain open due to uncertain demand, leading to revenue loss.\r\n* **Visitor Experience**: Tourists often lack information on **what is open**, limiting their stay and reducing repeat visits.\r\n* **Climate Sensitivity**: Autumn tourism is highly **weather-dependent**, requiring better planning to counter fluctuating conditions.\r\n\r\n### **The Hackathon Challenge**\r\n\r\nParticipants will **analyze tourism data** to develop **data-driven strategies** that extend the **late-autumn season** by improving:\r\n\r\n* **Tourist engagement** through better marketing and experience design.\r\n* **Business coordination** to ensure **accommodation, activities, and restaurants** remain open.\r\n* **Sustainability** by leveraging **local events, nature, and gastronomy** to attract off-season visitors.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## **2\\. Key Objectives for Hackathon Participants**\r\n\r\n1. **Understanding Visitor Demand:**\r\n    * Identify who visits in autumn and what they seek (e.g., hiking, photography, wine tastings).\r\n    * Analyze **past booking patterns**, **visitor origins**, and **website traffic trends**.\r\n    * Evaluate **weather patterns** and their influence on visitor flow.\r\n2. **Filling Gaps in the Tourism Offer:**\r\n    * **Mapping tourism availability**: What\u2019s open? What\u2019s missing? What should be coordinated?\r\n    * Propose **business synergies** that enable cost-effective operations in the shoulder season.\r\n3. **Creating Digital Tools for Decision-Making:**\r\n    * Develop **interactive maps** showing **real-time open locations, activities, and accommodations**.\r\n    * Design **regional collaboration dashboards** for tourism providers to align offers.\r\n4. **Marketing & Promotion Strategies:**\r\n    * Define **target audience segmentation** (e.g., adventure tourists, remote workers, cultural tourists).\r\n    * Propose **digital marketing and seasonal branding strategies** (social media campaigns, influencer partnerships, event packages).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## **3\\. Possible Solution Strategies**\r\n\r\n### **A. Experience & Product Development**\r\n\r\n* **Gastronomy & Local Culture:** Promote **culinary experiences** (game meat, alpine cheeses, autumn wine tastings, guided food trails).\r\n* **Outdoor Adventures:** Design and promote **season-specific activities**, such as:\r\n    * **Guided hikes** through golden larch forests.\r\n    * **Wildlife observation** (e.g., red deer rut).\r\n    * **Photography and nature retreats**.\r\n* **Event-Based Tourism:** Identify key **regional events** (festivals, markets) and integrate them into travel offers.\r\n* **Wellness & Remote Work Offers:** Develop **autumn wellness retreats** or \"workation\" packages for digital nomads.\r\n\r\n### **B. Enhancing Business Coordination**\r\n\r\n* **Tourism Availability Dashboard**: A tool for businesses to share **opening hours, available offers, and coordinate seasonal packages**.\r\n* **Multi-Destination Cooperation**: Link attractions across **30-50km radius** to create combined regional offers.\r\n* **Low-Cost Activity Expansion**: Introduce **affordable off-season activities** (e.g., guided heritage walks, mobile self-guided tours).\r\n\r\n### **C. Smart Data & Digital Solutions**\r\n\r\n* **Real-Time Interactive Maps**: Show what\u2019s open, where to go, and live availability.\r\n* **Predictive Models for Demand**: Using past booking and visitor flow data to forecast autumn demand.\r\n* **Weather-Responsive Offers**: Provide **alternative activity suggestions** in case of bad weather.\r\n\r\n## **4\\.
